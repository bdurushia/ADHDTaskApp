            // EAT THE FROG
            // 1. Define your GOALS and write them down.
            // 2. Break those goals down into TASKS.
            // 3. Break those tasks down into the smallest possible SUBTASKS.
            // 4. PRIORITIZE your tasks, and delete or delegate tasks you don't need to do.
            // 5. Schedule TIME on your CALENDAR every single day, ideally first thing in the morning, to work on your highest-priority goal task.
            // 6. Focus on your goal task(your frog) during your scheduled time, and work on it until it's complete. (This is the actual eating of the frog.)

            // HABIT TRACKING 
            // The habits strategy gives you a habit tracker right inside next to your to -do lists.
            // Whether you want to run 30 miles per week, floss daily,
            // or spend no more than 30 minutes on social media per day,
            // you can track these as a habit to make sure you are not straying too far from your ideals.
            // All your open habits will be shown in your day view so that you can record them easily.

            // REWARD TASK
            // A reward task is a task you get to do as a reward.
            // It can be anything that feels fun and rewarding to you. 

            // PROCRASTINATION WARNING
            // As soon as you schedule a task to a day, that first schedule date gets noted. 
            // When the procrastination count strategy is on it will always calculate how many days ago
            // this "first schedule" date and add an exclamation mark for each day to the front of the task title.
            // The exclamation marks are orange at first and after 3 days turn red.
            // The only way to get rid of the ugly marks is to complete the task.
            // Even unscheduling will keep counting up the marks.
